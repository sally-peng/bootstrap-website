 <p>A few months ago, a Stanford student was convicted of rape. June 2016, Brock Allen Turner, guilty of three counts of sexual assault, gets off with just three months time and three months probation. Brock’s case illustrates the bias seen in our judicial system. White privilege has given Turner his freedom, while people of color in similar cases, suffer quite a different fate.</p>

 <p>Especially upset about the outcome of Turner’s trial, Brian Banks speaks out about his experience with the justice system, as an African American Male. Banks was only sixteen, when he was convicted for a crime he did not commit. An ex-girlfriend of his, accused Banks of rape, eventually ending in a six year sentence. Turner’s case sparked emotion in Banks as he feels a connection with Turner’s victim. He states he was “raped in a sense of freedom” and that he understands what it feels like to be taken advantage of.</p>

<p>Continuing on this theme, the media has a tendency to overexaggerate the number of crimes committed by people of color. As presented by the image below, it is evident that this is yet again another manifestation of racial prejudice within our society.</p>
